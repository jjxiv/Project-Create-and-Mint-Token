# Project-Create-and-Mint-Token
The project consists of creating and minting a token using ERC20

## Description

The project's purpose is to demonstrate the knowledge of the student from Metacrafters, properly show how the program works, and to test the student's skill. In order to demonstrate the student's project, I was tasked to create and demonstrate the ERC20 token standard by applying it with a personal token, also including a simple program which mints, transfers, and burns token.

## Getting Started

### Setting up the program

To run this program, open a remix-etherieum IDE: https://remix.ethereum.org/
Before starting, make sure to set the compiler to version 0.8.18.

### Running the program
1. Create a file with your preferred name. (ex. ERC20_Almoro.sol)
2. Paste the source code from the file (ERC20_Almoro.sol)
3. Press Ctrl + S to compile and save, then click deploy under deploy and transactions
4. After clicking deploy with an initial amount of tokens, now the user can explore and use the code.
